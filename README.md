- 👋 Hi, I’m @tyson225
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a Full Stack Developer using React. I am open to working for a company or doing freelance work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React & Redux
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects where I can make immediate contributions with skills I already have or have a challenge to 
      create and learn under the guidance of someone with more experience than I currently have.
